### FPGA-controlled cyber-physical Pong game

This project was done in collaboration with Intel and consisted of making an application-specific cyber-physical system using an FPGA (a hardware programming device that serves as a digital circuit design and prototyping tool).

In this team project, a Pong game was made in Processing and controlled by the FPGA using the built-in accelerometer and an infrared sensor. I contributed mainly by writing the code for the FPGA, using VHDL, and in the documentation of the project.
