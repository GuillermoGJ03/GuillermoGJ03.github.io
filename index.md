### FPGA-controlled cyber-physical Pong game

This project was done in collaboration with Intel and consisted of making an application-specific cyber-physical system using an FPGA, a hardware programming device that serves as a digital circuit design and prototyping tool

In this team project, a Pong game was made in Processing and controlled by the FPGA using the built-in accelerometer and an infrared sensor. I contributed mainly by writing the code for the FPGA to function as the contol unit, specifically DE10-Lite Altera MAX 10 FPGA model, using VHDL as the hardware descriptor language and Intel Quartus Prime as the software design.

### Microcontroller-based gas detection safety system
Gas detectors help to detect dangerous concentrations of harmful substances in the environment and are of particular importance in industry. For this team project, made in collaboration with Intel, a digital system for gas detection and measurement of environmental variables for alarm activation and a ventilation system was designed and prototyped, in addition to a dashboard showing the levels of the measured variables.

I contributed in this project collaborating in the writing of the code for the ATMega32 microcontroller, in C, to use and coordinate several of its components and functions such as: Timers, GPIOs, Serial communication (UART), PWM and interrupts. In addition, I was in charge of the selection of the system components (bill of material).
